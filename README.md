# PizzeriaJava
- A series of Java classes and interfaces that simulates how a pizzeria works.

## Description/Features
- the customers will be able to order (one or more) pizzas, and customizing it with the preferred toppings (if available);
- the pizzeria will add each order to a queue of orders;
- the pizzeria will serve each pizza in the same order of the queue, to the respective customer;
- once the pizza is served, the pizzeria will calculate the final price as the sum of all pizzas being ordered by that customer;
- the pizzeria will display/print all the served pizzas.
- the pizzeria implements different strategies to maximize profit;

## Extra details
- assume the pizzeria has few customers (two or three);
- assume each customer orders at least one pizza (ideally two);
- use TDD (Test Driven Development);
- (try to) use some of the follollwing patterns where most fitting: Adapter, Chain of Responsability, Composite, Decorator, Singleton, Strategy.

## Future ideas/features
- the pizzeria may run out of certain toppings;
- the pizzeria may apply various discounts.
